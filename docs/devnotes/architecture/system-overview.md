# System Architecture Overview

**Date**: 2024-03-03
**Author**: Development Team

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Omnivore system architecture, its main components, and how they interact with each other.

## System Components

### 1. Core Services

- **Web Application**
  - Frontend: React/TypeScript-based web client
  - Backend: Node.js API server
  - GraphQL API layer

- **Mobile Applications**
  - iOS (Swift)
  - Android (Kotlin)

- **Image Proxy Service**
  - Handles image processing and caching
  - Optimizes images for different devices and contexts

### 2. Infrastructure

- **Database Layer**
  - Primary data store
  - Caching layer
  - Search indexing

- **Machine Learning Services**
  - Content analysis
  - Recommendation engine
  - Text processing

### 3. Development Tools

- Monorepo structure using Lerna
- Docker-based development environment
- Continuous Integration/Deployment pipeline

## Architecture Decisions

Key architectural decisions are documented in the [decisions](../decisions/) directory. Major decisions include:

- Use of TypeScript across the stack
- GraphQL for API layer
- Monorepo approach for code organization
- Docker-based deployment strategy

## System Interaction Flow

1. Client requests (Web/Mobile) → API Gateway
2. API Gateway → GraphQL Layer
3. GraphQL Layer → Microservices
4. Data persistence → Database Layer
5. Asynchronous processing → Background Jobs

## Development Environment

The development environment is containerized using Docker, with services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. See the [setup guide](../setup/development-environment.md) for detailed instructions.

## Future Considerations

- Scalability improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional service integrations
- Enhanced ML capabilities
